Objective
Each player is dealt a Role Card at the beginning of the game telling them what their goal is. Usually this involves certain players being alive or dead at the end of the game. At the end of the game, whoever's goal has been met wins. There can be many winners or no winner. Most players can still win after they die, unless they die of dishonor.

Setup

    Separate the drink cards into Poison and Wine and place them in face-up piles in the middle of the table
    Place the Dishonor Tokens and Badges of Honor near the drink cards
    Give each player a duel token
    Place the remainder back in the box
    Prepare the Roles deck (choose a setup or make one up!)
        5 player Palace Skirmish: King, Assassin, Lawman, Guard, Rebel
        5 player Royal Intrigue: King, Queen, Prince, Princess, Suitor
        5 player Round Table: King,  Assassin, Red Knight, Blue Knight, Gold Knight
        6 player Round Table: King,  Assassin, Red Knight, Blue Knight, Black Knight, White Knight
        7 player Round Table: King,  Assassin, Red Knight, Blue Knight, Black Knight, White Knight, Gold Knight

    Place the remaining Roles Cards back in the box
    Prepare the first course (choose a setup or make one up!)
        5 player Basic: Cup Bearer, Regent,  Chaplain, Chaplain
    Prepare the second course (choose a setup or make one up!)
        5 player Basic: Herald, Juggler, Taster, Constable
    Put the remaining Honor Cards back in the box
    Shuffle the Roles deck and deal one card face down to each player
    Players keep their Roles secret, except the King who flips his face up

Game play
A game of Feast is played over three three-minute [too long with few players?] rounds. There are a few actions that need to take place during each round, but most actions don't happen in any particular order, just as players choose to take them. At the beginning of each round, flip the three-minute sand timer. The round ends when the sand runs out and any player declares "times up".

At the beginning of the first round, give the King the first course of Honor Cards. Over the course of the first round, he may give one Honor Card to each other player (even dead players) colored (unused) side up. At the end of the first round, if the King still has any honor cards, they are shuffled and randomly dealt to each player that had not received one (this may also happen if the King died).

At the beginning of the second round, give the King the second course of Honor Cards. Over the course of the second round, he may give one Honor Card to each other player (even dead players) colored (unused) side up. At the end of the second round, if the King still has any honor cards, they are shuffled and randomly dealt to each player that had not received one (this may also happen if the King and Regent died) .

At the beginning of the second round, give the Cup Bearer wine cards equal to the number of players minus one, and poison cards equal to half the number of players rounded down (so in a 5 player game, 5 wine and 2 poison). Over the course of the second round, he or she mus give one Drink Card face to each living player (including himself). At the end of the second round, if any living player has not been given a Drink Card, they are randomly dealt one from the remaining cards that the Cup Barer picked up at the beginning of the round (this may also happen if the Cup Bearer died).

At the end of the third round, carry out a Toast:

    All players stick there hands in the middle, count down from three, then give a thumbs up or thumbs down.
    Players that gave a thumbs down receive one dishonor
    Players that gave a thumbs up reveal their drink card. If it is a wine card, they flip it back down. If it is a poison card, they die.

During the rounds, there are a few actions players can take:

    Showing Role Cards
        Players may not show their role card to the table. They may, however, show their card to the players next to them. If two players agree to show each other their cards, they must follow through. [Maybe shouldn't be allowed to show cards???]
    Dueling
        Each player begins the game with a Duel Token. At any time, while a round is in progress, a player may spend this token (placing it back in the box) to challenge any other living player to a duel. When this happens, pause the timer. Ideally everyone should freeze in place, a couple people should gasp, and maybe someone should faint. Those aren't necessary but do help. All eyes then turn to the challenged player, who may either accept or reject the challenge. If they reject, they gain one dishonor. If they accept, the two players must play rock-paper-scissors. If one player wins, the other player dies. If they draw, they both survive. When the duel is over, resume the timer.
    Honor Actions
        Most Honor Cards give their owner a one-time action they can preform. After doing the action, they flip their Honor card onto the grey (used) side.

Dishonor:
Dishonor Cards/Tokens are given to players that are deemed not to have failed to live nobly. They essentially count as "-1 Honor", while Honor Cards and Badges count as "+1 Honor". If a player ever has a dishonor and a face-up Honor Card or Badge of Honor, they must flip an Honor Card face-down, or discard a Badge of Honor. In doing so they discard the dishonor. The King only holds Honor Cards, they never apply to him, so he can never get rid of dishonor this way. If a player ever has 3 [should be 2?] dishonor, they immediately die of dishonor. A player who dies of dishonor always loses, even if their objective is fulfilled. For roles like the King, who lose if they die, dying from dishonor isn't really any different than dying in other ways. But you should still feel a little bit worse inside.

Order:
Since there are no turns, actions take place in the order people declare them. This may occasionally mean needing to remember what each person has said they are doing so that you can carry them out in order, if people declare an action before the previous one is finished.

Death:
Dead players are not affected by any game effects. When a player dies, their two neighbors are considered to be next to each other. Dead players can still talk to influence the living, and can still win.
